This book does not provide a beginner-level introduction to Java EE as it is written as an intermediate/advanced course in Java EE development with WildFly 8.1. In Detail This book starts with an introduction to EJB 3 and how to set up the environment, including the configuration of a MySQL database for use with WildFly. We will then develop object-relational mapping with Hibernate 4, build and package the application with Maven, and then deploy it in WildFly 8.1, followed by a demonstration of the use of Facelets in a web application. Moving on from that, we will create an Ajax application in the Eclipse IDE, compile and package it using Maven, and run the web application on WildFly 8.1 with a MySQL database. In the final leg of this book, we will discuss support for generating and parsing JSON with WildFly 8.1.');
